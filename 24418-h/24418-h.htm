<h1><big>The QUANTUM JUMP</big><br

<h5>ILLUSTRATOR LLEWELLYN</h5>

<p class="blurb"><i>Captain Brandon was a pioneer. He explored the far
reaches of space and reported back on how things were
out there. So it was pretty disquieting to find out that
the &ldquo;far reaches of space&rdquo; knew more about what went
on at home than he did.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="firstword">BRANDON was looking at the
Milky Way. Through his
<ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original lacks hyphen">perma-glas</ins> canopy, he could see
it trailing across the black velvet
of space like a white bridal
veil. Below his SC9B scout-ship
stretched the red dust deserts of
Sirius Three illuminated by the
thin light of two ice moons. He
looked at the Milky Way.</p>

<p><a name="png.002" id="png.002"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">21</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He looked at it as a man looks
at a flickering fireplace and
thinks of other things. He
thought of the sun, 52 trillion
miles away, a pinpoint of light
lost in the dazzle of the Milky
Way&mdash;the Earth a speck of dust
in orbit just as this planet was
to its master, Sirius.</p>

<p>Nine light years away. Of
course, thirteen years had passed
on Earth since they had left, because
the trip took four years by
RT&mdash;relative time. But even
four years is a long time to be
shut up in Astro One with five
other men, especially when one
of them was the imperious Colonel
Towers.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />&ldquo;A quantum jump&mdash;that&#8217;s the
way to beat the Reds,&rdquo; the colonel
had said a thousand times.
His well-worn expression had
nothing to do with quantum mechanics&mdash;the
actual change in
atomic configuration due to the
application of sufficient energy.
Rather, it was a slang expression
referring to a major advance
in inter-planetary travel
due to a maximum scientific and
technological effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let &#8217;em have Mars and
Venus,&rdquo; the colonel would say&mdash;&ldquo;Let
&#8217;em have the whole damn
Solar System! We&#8217;ll make a
quantum jump&mdash;leap-frog ahead
of &#8217;em. We&#8217;ll be the first men to
set foot on a planet of another
solar system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Four years had gone by in the
ship; thirteen years on Earth.
Four years of Colonel Towers.
Military discipline grew more
strict each day. Space does
funny things to some men. The
&ldquo;we&#8217;ll be the first men&rdquo; had
turned into, &ldquo;<em>I&#8217;ll</em> be the first
<em>man</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was Captain Brandon
who drew the assignment of
scouting Sirius Three for a suitable
landing place for Astro, of
sampling its atmosphere and observing
<ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'meteorlogical'">meteorological</ins> conditions.
Even as Brandon climbed into
the scout-ship, Towers had cautioned
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, your assignment
is to locate a firm landing site
with ample protection from the
elements. Under no circumstances
are you to land yourself.
Is that clearly understood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brandon nodded, was launched
and now was cruising one hundred
thousand feet above the
alien planet.</p>

<p>Brandon tilted the ship up on
one wing and glanced down at
the brick-red expanse of desert.
Tiny red mists marked dust
storms. Certainly this was no
place to set down the full weight
of Astro nor to protect the crew
and equipment from abrasive
dust.</p>

<p>He righted the ship. Far on
the horizon was a bank of atmospheric
clouds. Perhaps conditions
were more promising there.
He shoved the power setting to
90 per cent.</p>

<p>A fire warning indicator light
blinked on. Instantly Brandon&#8217;s
eyes were on the instrument
panel. The tailpipe temperature
seemed all right. It could be a
false indication. He eased back
<a name="png.003" id="png.003"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">22</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>on the power setting. Maybe the
light would go out. But it didn&#8217;t.
Instead he felt a surging rumble
deep in the bowels of the ship.
Luminous needles danced and
a second red light flashed on.</p>

<p>He snapped the <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 spelling of original retained">vidio</ins> switch
and depressed the mike button.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Astro One, this is Brandon.
Over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A steady crackling sound filled
his earphones; a grid of light
and shadow fluttered on the
screen. A thought entered his
mind. Maybe he had put too
much planet curvature between
Astro and himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Astro One, this is Brandon.
Come in, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A series of muffled explosions
rocked the ship. He chopped the
power back all the way and listened
intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May Day! May Day! Astro,
this is Brandon. May Day!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />A faint voice sputtered in his
ear, the face of Reinhardt, the
radioman appeared before him.
&ldquo;Brandon, this is Astro One.
What is your position? Over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brandon&#8217;s voice sounded
strange and distant as he talked
to his oxygen mask. &ldquo;Heading&mdash;one-eight-zero.
Approximately
six hundred miles from you.
Altitude one hundred thousand
feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the nature of your
trouble, Brandon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Brandon could answer,
the face of Colonel Towers appeared
beside the radioman&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brandon, what&#8217;re you trying
to pull?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Engine trouble, sir. Losing
altitude fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know the nature of
the trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Negative. Might have thrown
a compressor blade. Got a fire
indication, then a compressor
surge. Chopped off the power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Towers frowned. &ldquo;Why didn&#8217;t
you use straight rocket power?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind now. You may
have encountered oxygen or
hydrogen-rich atmosphere&mdash;melted
your compressor blades.
Try an air start on straight
rocket. I want that ship back,
Brandon. Repeat, I want that
ship back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may be able to ride it down.
Get it on the deck intact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try an air start, Brandon.&rdquo;
Towers leaned forward, his eyes
fixed on Brandon. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t want
you to set foot on that planet,
get me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there wasn&#8217;t time to try
anything. The cabin was filling
with fumes. Brandon looked
down. A fringe of blue flame
crept along between the floor and
the bottom of the pilot&#8217;s capsule.
A cold ache filled the cavity of
his stomach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late. I&#8217;m on fire! Capsuling
out. Repeat, capsuling out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brandon&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel&#8217;s glaring face
flicked off as Brandon pushed the
pre-ejection lever into the lock
position severing all connections
between the ship and the pilot&#8217;s
capsule. Brandon had a strange,
detached feeling as he pushed
the ejection button.</p>

<p><a name="png.004" id="png.004"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">23</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>There was an explosion and
the pilot&#8217;s capsule shot up like
a wet bar of soap squeezed out
of a giant&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>The ship turned into a torch
and sank beneath him. Brandon
closed his eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>When he opened them he was
staring at the Milky Way, then
the desert as he tumbled over
and over. He talked to the Milky
Way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten seconds. Should wait at
least ten seconds before releasing
the drogue chute so I&#8217;ll clear the
ship.&rdquo; Then he spoke to the desert.
&ldquo;And maybe another ten to
give the capsule time to slow
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He counted then pulled the
chute release. Nylon streamed
out behind him and snapped
open with a tremendous jar. A
moment later, bundles of metal
ribbons floated out and billowed
into a giant umbrella. The last
thing he remembered was the
taste of blood on his lips.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />When Brandon opened his eyes
he was staring at the silvery
disks of the twin moons. They
were high in the sky, obscuring
the center of the Milky Way.
Funny he should be lying on his
back looking at the sky, he
thought. Then he remembered.</p>

<p>The capsule was on its back
and Brandon was still strapped
securely to the seat. His whole
body ached. Tendons had been
pulled, muscles strained from the
force of the ejection. His oxygen
mask was still in place, but his
helmet hung partly loose. He adjusted
it automatically, then
unbuckled the seat straps. He
took a deep breath. Under the
oxygen mask, he was aware of
dried blood clotted in his nostrils,
caked around the corners
of his lips.</p>

<p>With an effort he sat up on
the seat back and looked through
the perma-glas. A tangle of
cords stretched out to the nylon
of the main chute draped over a
dust dune. Beyond it he could
see the gleaming metal ribbons
of the drogue chute.</p>

<p>Ahead of him, behind some
low hills, he could see a dull red
glow. The ship, he thought. Astro
may already be hovering
over it.</p>

<p>He dragged the survival kit
from behind the seat and pulled
out some rations, a first-aid kit,
finally a tele-talkie. Raising the
antenna, he plugged in the mike
cord from his mask and held
down the &ldquo;talk&rdquo; key with his
thumb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Astro One, this is Brandon.
Come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he talked a picture flickered
on the screen. It was the
radio room on Astro One. Colonel
Towers was pacing back and
forth in front of the radioman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I keep trying to raise
him?&rdquo; he heard Reinhardt ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn fool stunt,&rdquo; Towers
sputtered. &ldquo;Know what I think?
I think he went down deliberately.
Just to be the first human being
to walk the ground of a
planet of another solar system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Astro, this is Brandon.
Come in please.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.005" id="png.005"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">24</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Towers continued to pace and
talk. &ldquo;He did it to spite me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can&#8217;t raise him sir,&rdquo;
the radio operator said. &ldquo;Maybe
he didn&#8217;t get out of it alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel Towers, can&#8217;t you
hear me?&rdquo; Brandon yelled into
his oxygen mask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He got out all right,&rdquo; the
colonel said. &ldquo;He&#8217;s just stalling
to make it look good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We aren&#8217;t going to give up
the search are we, sir?&rdquo; asked
the radioman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would serve his soul
right.&rdquo; The colonel stopped pacing
and faced the radioman.
&ldquo;Keep trying to raise him, Reinhardt.
I&#8217;m going to bring us
down to forty thousand feet and
search the area where he went
down. Helluva waste of rocket
fuel tooling around in the atmosphere,&rdquo;
he muttered, disappearing
through a bulkhead
door.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />&ldquo;Wait! Colonel Towers!&rdquo;
Brandon called. But he knew it
was no use. Obviously he could
pick up Astro but they could
neither see nor hear him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Brandon, this is Astro
calling. Over.&rdquo; The radioman
repeated the phrase a dozen
times and each time Brandon
acknowledged, swore and acknowledged
again. Finally, in
desperation, he switched off the
tele-talkie.</p>

<p>He snapped open the back of
the unit and studied the maze
of transistors, resistors, and
<ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 spelling of original retained">capacitators</ins>. If there was something
wrong it was subtle, like
a burned out resistor or a shorted
condenser. Whatever it was,
it was beyond emergency repair.
He dropped the tele-talkie behind
the seat and examined the
gauge on his oxygen tank. There
was enough to last the night but
not much more.</p>

<p>He sat down in the capsule to
think. The first thing they&#8217;d locate
is the burning ship, he decided.
Then they would probably
start searching in ever-widening
circles. But would they see him
in the faint light of the ice
moons?</p>

<p>He looked back at the nylon
chute again. Another thought
ran through his mind. Suppose
they don&#8217;t spot me in the dark.
When the sun&mdash;Sirius, I mean&mdash;comes
up, there&#8217;s a good
chance they&#8217;ll spot the parachute
and search for him.</p>

<p>He slid the canopy open and
looked down at the red soil of
Sirius Three. He hesitated for
a moment, then swung his feet
over the side and dropped to the
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least I&#8217;ll have that satisfaction,&rdquo;
he said, grinning under
his oxygen mask.</p>

<p>Very much aware of gravity
after years of weightlessness, he
walked to the canopy of the
chute and spread it out on the
flat ground in a full circle. It
billowed in the wind. He searched
around, found some glassy
black rocks and anchored down
the chute.</p>

<p>Then he looked at the orange
glow that marked the funeral
pyre of the ship. He had a decision
<a name="png.006" id="png.006"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">25</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to make; stay here with the
capsule or head for the fire.</p>

<p>Couldn&#8217;t be more than a thousand
yards away, he decided.
Charging a <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original lacks hyphen">walk-around</ins> oxygen
bottle, he transferred his oxygen
hose to it. He snapped the survival
kit to his belt and picked
up the tele-talkie.</p>

<p>The ship was more than a
thousand yards away. The first
mile was across flat desert. He
picked his way cautiously, his
boots churning up clouds of
powdery dust. He remembered
the Russian reports of the weird
and deadly creatures they had
encountered in the Martian deserts.</p>

<p>But aside from a few gray
patches of brush there seemed
to be no sign of life. After all,
he thought, the Earth held no
life for the better part of its
existence. And Towers had selected
this planet because it
bore relatively the same relationship
to the brighter, hotter
Sirius as did the Earth to the
sun. While farther away it
should have approximately the
same conditions as did the
Earth. And it had seas, not as
large as on Earth, but seas,
nevertheless.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Yet there was a fallacy in the
argument. Presumably all of
the stars in the outer arms of
the Milky Way and their planets
were about the same age. With
similar conditions as the Earth,
life must have been born and
walked out of the seas of Sirius
Three just as it did on Earth.</p>

<p>Something scurried into a
<ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'whisp'">wisp</ins> of brush, as if to bear out
Brandon&#8217;s realization. He froze,
his eyes on the brush, his hand
reaching for his hydro-static
shock pistol. He could hear
nothing but the wind hollowing
his ears. He stood for a long
moment, then cautiously skirted
the brush, and continued on toward
the burning ship. There
was an odd clicking sound and
he stopped. It sounded again.
Brandon realized he was perspiring
despite the chill of the desert
night. Again he moved on, the
sound fading in the distance behind
him.</p>

<p>The next mile brought him to
a great sheet of ancient lava laid
bare by the elements. He climbed
to the top. The fire still seemed
to be about a thousand yards
ahead, beyond a ridge of low
hills.</p>

<p>A distant flare lit up the sky
ahead of him. It glowed for a
few moments and died. They&#8217;ve
found the ship, he thought. After
four years, I had completely
forgotten about the store of
photo-flash flares.</p>

<p>He watched for awhile but
saw no more flares. Finally he
scrambled down the other side
of the lava sheet and continued
on toward the wreck, moving
slowly but steadily.</p>

<p>The third mile brought him
to the scene of the crash. A
smoking cylinder of fused metal
lay in a gully. Parts were strewn
along the bottom. A wing, untouched
by the fire, was leaning
tip down against the edge of
<a name="png.007" id="png.007"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">26</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>another lava sheet some distance
away.</p>

<p>He sat down. Another flare
flashed in the sky behind him
silhouetting a row of grotesque
trees. I&#8217;m over here, you fools,
he thought. He watched until the
flare flickered out, then turned
his head back toward the remains
of the ship. There wasn&#8217;t
much of a glow to it now. It
would be hard to see unless Astro
was right on top of it.</p>

<p>He raised the antenna on the
tele-talkie and snapped it on.
The screen glowed into life.
Towers was stepping through
the bulkhead door into the radio
room. Just like a television
play in installments, Brandon
thought. Scene two coming up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No sign of him at the scene
of the crash,&rdquo; Towers told Reinhardt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he got out,&rdquo; observed Reinhardt,
&ldquo;he could be a hundred
miles away or more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>If</em> he got out,&rdquo; Towers said
in a tone that irritated Brandon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got out,&rdquo; Brandon said.
&ldquo;And right now I&#8217;m walking
around your precious planet like
a boy scout. Damn this tele-talkie!
I&#8217;d give a year&#8217;s pay if
you could see me now, Towers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We may yet spot the escape
capsule,&rdquo; Reinhardt was saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re still continuing the
search,&rdquo; put in Towers. &ldquo;But I
don&#8217;t mind telling you I&#8217;m not
wasting much more fuel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The radio operator started to
say something, hesitated and finally
settled for, &ldquo;yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brandon swore and snapped
off the set. He looked at his
walk-around bottle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&#8217;t stay here any longer,&rdquo;
he muttered.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />He couldn&#8217;t find the capsule.
He walked three, perhaps four
miles. He stopped and blotted his
moist brow with his sleeve. He
wasn&#8217;t going to find it. Before
him stretched an endless carpet
of red dust. The light from the
two moons was growing dim, as
each settled toward different
horizons.</p>

<p>He sat down. A cloud of powdery
dust settled over his legs.
The lightness in his head told
him that his oxygen was running
out. The weakness in his muscles
reminded him that it had been a
long time since he had walked
in a planet&#8217;s gravity. A distant
flare lit up the horizon. He
choked off a sob, and beat his
fist in the red dust. A wave of
nausea swept over him. Bitter
stomach juices welled up in his
throat but he swallowed them
down again.</p>

<p>Desperately he turned on the
tele-talkie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Astro, this is Brandon,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brandon, this is Astro,&rdquo;
Reinhardt said.</p>

<p>Brandon&#8217;s body tensed.
&ldquo;Thank God I finally got through
to you. Listen, Reinhardt, I must
be about three&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brandon, this is Astro,&rdquo; said
Reinhardt in a monotone. He
said it again and again and
again.</p>

<p>Brandon fell back on the
<a name="png.008" id="png.008"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">27</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>ground. His breathing was
short, strained. His face was
bathed in perspiration. The oxygen,
he realized, was giving out.</p>

<p>What are the odds, that the
air of Sirius Three is breathable,
he wondered. One in a hundred?
The planet has water and both
animal and plant life. Certainly
it has sufficient gravity to hold
its oxygen. But what other elements&mdash;noxious
gases might be
present. Maybe the odds are
closer to one in fifty, he decided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&#8217;s no gamble when you
have nothing to lose,&rdquo; he told the
Milky Way.</p>

<p>Ripping off his oxygen mask,
he took a deep breath of the
alien atmosphere. The dust
choked him, his ears rang. Black
spots danced before his eyes,
then melted into solid blackness.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />Brandon could hear Towers&#8217;
voice in a vortex of darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&#8217;s face it&mdash;Brandon is
dead. Must have burned with the
ship, at least that&#8217;s the way the
report will read. Get me, Reinhardt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the disembodied
voice of Reinhardt replied
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;re going to set her down
on a solid piece of ground near
one of the oceans.&rdquo; There was a
pause and Brandon could almost
see Colonel Towers drawing up
to his full height. &ldquo;I&#8217;m going to
be the first man to set foot on
a planet of another solar system.
Know what that means, Reinhardt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A quantum jump sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right. <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transciber's note:
 original reads 'Leap-froging'">Leap-frogging</ins> ahead of
the Reds. Wait till they read the
name Colonel John Towers&mdash;maybe
<em>General</em> John Towers&mdash;<ins class="TNsilent" title="Transciber's note:
 original lacks period"><em>General</em>.</ins>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brandon opened his eyes.
Sirius was turning the sky to
gray, trimming a few scattered
clouds with gold. As he stared
at the sky, Sirius rose with a
brassy glare. Near it he could
see its white hot dwarf star companion.
It was going to be a real
scorcher, he decided; worse than
any desert on Earth. He sat up
stiffly.</p>

<p>On the tele-talkie screen, Reinhardt,
alone in the radio room,
was calling quietly for Brandon.
The bulkhead door swung open
and Towers poked his head
through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knock that off,&rdquo; said Towers
sternly, &ldquo;and take your landing
station.&rdquo; As Reinhardt rose to
his feet, Brandon reached over
and turned off the set.</p>

<p>Brandon took a deep breath.
His head spun and for the first
time he realized that he was still
alive. He gazed across the shimmering
desert to a ridge of
scrubby hills. Blue mountains
rose up beyond them. Great floes
of black lava had rolled down
onto the desert floor at some distant
time. They were spotted
with clumps of gray grass even
as was the desert. The hills were
studded with weird trees standing
stiff, branches outstretched,
like an army of scarecrows.</p>

<p>The air of Sirius Three was
doing strange things to him.
Two of the trees seemed to be
<a name="png.009" id="png.009"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>moving. He swayed and sat
heavily.</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"
 />As he watched through a haze
of red dust whipped up by the
morning breeze, the two trees
came closer, turned into men
wearing desert uniforms and
leaned over him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; one of them
asked.</p>

<p>Brandon said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We saw you from our observation
station over on the hill,&rdquo;
said the other pointing.</p>

<p>They helped Brandon to his
feet and gave him a swig of cool,
sweet water from a canteen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m Captain Brandon, of the
Astro One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Astro One?&rdquo; The man removed
his pith helmet to wipe
his brow and Brandon noticed
the gleaming US insignia on the
front of the helmet. &ldquo;The Astro
One left Earth thirteen years
ago,&rdquo; the man said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only four years by RT,&rdquo;
Brandon said.</p>

<p>The man smiled and put his
helmet back on his head. &ldquo;A lot
of things have happened since
you left. There was a war which
we won, and I guess you guys
were almost forgotten. And
there was a lot of technological
<ins class="TNsilent" title="Transciber's note:
 original lacks closing quote">development.&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean you had a quantum
jump?&rdquo; asked Brandon <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'parrotting'">parroting</ins>
Colonel Towers&#8217; favorite
expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Odd you would know that,&rdquo;
replied the second man. &ldquo;It was
through quantum mechanics that
we learned to approximate the
speed of light. While nine years
pass on Earth when we make
the trip, our RT is mere moments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; Brandon said.
&ldquo;You must have passed us up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Been on this planet for nearly
a year,&rdquo; the first man said.
&ldquo;Got men on dozens of planetary
systems throughout the Milky
Way. One ship went a thousand
light years out. By the time they
come back, civilization on Earth
will be two thousand years
older.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got a tele-talkie?&rdquo;
Brandon asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the first man,
producing a set one-third the
size of Brandon&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you tune it to 28.6 microcycles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; the man said again.
He turned a dial with his thumb
and handed the unit to Brandon.
Brandon depressed the &ldquo;talk&rdquo;
button. A crystal clear image of
Colonel Towers, putting the finishing
touches on his full dress
uniform, appeared on the screen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an historic occasion,&rdquo;
Colonel Towers was announcing
to his crew. &ldquo;Open the
hatch&mdash;and, Reinhardt, be sure
to stand by with the motion picture
camera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Colonel Towers,&rdquo;
said Brandon quietly.</p>

<p>Towers swung around and
looked out at Brandon. The colonel&#8217;s
face paled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have something to tell
you,&rdquo; said Brandon grinning,
&ldquo;about the quantum jump.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
